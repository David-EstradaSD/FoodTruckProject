# Food Truck Project
## Overview
This program simulates a Food Truck application wherein users can input the names and ratings of up to five food trucks of their choice. In return, the user may choose to receive information back regarding their input through a menu selection.

##Technical Skills Used
* Java
* Encapsulation (getter and setter methods)
* Constructor methods
* User input with Scanner
* For loops and while loops
* If/Else statements
* Switch statements
* One dimensional arrays

## How to Run
This program runs on Eclipse and requires user input on a keyboard

##Lessons Learned
I have learned how to apply getters and setters to ensure program encapsulation, as well as implementing multiple constructors by utilizing the this() constructor. I became more comfortable with conditional expressions and using printf to display appropriate decimal places in double variables.
